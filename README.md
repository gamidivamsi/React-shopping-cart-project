# Summary Of The Project
The outcome of this project(React-shopping-Cart) is, that by using this project we can buy products and we can add them to the cart, it is the same as online shopping apps but I developed it. In the final outcome, only a few items are available, we can add many more to the project, and coming to the cart session we can edit, update, and delete if we do not need them. One more point  is, in the end, we can see the total amount we need to pay. Finally, one thing I need to say is even though it seems like a simple project, in the implementation I used almost all concepts present in the react JS to develop this project.
