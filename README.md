# Summary Of The Project
The outcome of this project(React-shopping-Cart) is, that by using this project we can buy products and we can add them to the cart, it is the same as online shopping apps but I developed it. In the final outcome, only a few items are available, we can add many more to the project, and coming to the cart session we can edit, update, and delete if we do not need them. One more point  is, in the end, we can see the total amount we need to pay. Finally, one thing I need to say is even though it seems like a simple project, in the implementation I used almost all concepts present in the react JS to develop this project.


# Need To Install
some commands need to run before running the code

# npm install
if you run this command all npm packages will get installed and with this, we can also find some dependencies and package.json files, which are used in the project, it is the first step we need to do before running our project

# npm init react-app
The use of this command is that a new folder will be created and in that, we can find all folders regarding our project. Whereas "react-app" means it is the folder name and we can give any name to it.

# npm add phosphor-react
By using this command, we can install some icons that are used in this project like the shop symbol, which indicates the cart symbol and we can find many different icons in this command

# react-router-dom
In react applications, we need to have different routes for our application. so for that, this command is used.
